##Waypoint

Waypoint was made for people who like to go places. Discover and create adventures like scavenger hunts, pub crawls, city tours, alternate reality games and more. Explore your city in a whole new way! The only limit is your imagination.

The native mobile version of the app was made using React Native and the Google Maps API. The web route creation companion was made with React, the Google Maps API, and Semantic UI.
